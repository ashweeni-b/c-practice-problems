## Swapping two numbers

### Problem Statement
Take numbers num1 and num2 from user and then swap it.

---

### Input
Two integers num1 and num2.

### Output Format:
Two lines demonstrating numbers before swapping and numbers after swapping in single lines.

---

### Test Case 1
Input: 
3 5 <br>
Output: 
Numbers before swapping: 3 5 <br>
Numbers after swapping: 5 3 <br>

### Test Case 2
Input: 
2 4 <br>
Output: 
Numbers before swapping: 2 4 <br>
Numbers after swapping: 4 2 <br>

---

### Algorithm (Approach 1)
1. Input numbers `num1` and `num2`.
2. Store the sum of two numbers in `num1`.
3. Store the difference of two numbers in `num2`.
4. Store the difference of two numbers again in `num1`.
