## Smallest of two numbers

### Problem Statement
Take numbers num1 and num2 from user and output the smallest of the two numbers.

---

### Input
Two integers num1 and num2 representing the two numbers.

### Output
Print 1 if num1 is smaller than num2, otherwise print 0 if num2 is smaller than num1.

---

### Test Case 1
Input: 3 5 <br>
Output: 1 <br>

### Test Case 2
Input: 3 1 <br>
Output: 0 <br>

---

### Algorithm (Approach 1)
1. Input `num1` and `num2`.
2. Check if `num1` is smaller than `num2` or not - `num1 < num2`.
3. If `num1` is smaller than `num2` output `1` otherwise `0`.
