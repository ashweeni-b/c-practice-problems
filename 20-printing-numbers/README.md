## Printing numbers

### Problem Statement
To print numbers using loops

---

### Input
No input. 

### Output 
Prints the numbers on new line

---

### Algorithm 
1. Initialize `i` to 1
2. Check for condition for e.g. `i <= 100`
3. Print the value of i until the condition is satisfied
4. After printing the value, increment each time the value of i by 1
5. Check for condition again, and continue the loop
