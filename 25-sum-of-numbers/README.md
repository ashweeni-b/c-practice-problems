### Problem Statement
Calculate the sum of all numbers between 5 and 50, including 5 and 50.

---

### Output 
Print the sum of the numbers

---

### Output:
Sum = 1265 <br>

---

### Algorithm 
1. Initialize `i` to 5. 
2. Until `i <= 50>`, calculate sum as, `sum = sum + i`.
3. Increment `i` by 1.
4. Finally print the value of `sum`.
