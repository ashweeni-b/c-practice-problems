## Area of Square, Rectangle and Circle

### Problem Statement

Write a program to calculate the area of square, rectangle and circle using functions.

---

### Input
Integers side, length and breadth representing the side of the square and length and breadth of the rectangle respectively. <br>
Floating point number radius representing the radius of the circle.

### Output
Print the area of square, rectangle and circle.

---

### Test Case 

Input: <br>
Enter side: 4 <br>
Enter length: 3 <br>
Enter breadth: 5 <br>
Enter radius: 7 <br>

Output: <br>
Area of square = 16 <br>
Area of rectangle = 15 <br>
Aarea of circle = 153.860001 <br>

---

### Algorithm

1. Input `side`, `length`, `breadth` and `radius`.
2. Compute the areas using functions and following formulae - <br>
        Area of square = side * side <br>
        Area of rectangle = length * breadth <br>
        Area of circle = 3.14 * radius * radius <br> 
3. Output the areas of square, rectangle and circle.
