## Sum, product and average of two numbers

### Problem Statement
Write a function to calculate the sum, product and average of two numbers. Print the average, sum and product in the main function.

---

### Input
Two integers num1 and num2 representing the two numbers

### Output 
Print the sum, product and average of the two numbers each on new lines

---

### Test Case 1
Input: <br>
Enter num1: 12 <br>
Enter num2: 3 <br>

Output: <br>
Sum = 15 <br>
Product = 36 <br>
Average = 7.50 <br>

### Test Case 2
Input: <br>
Enter num1: 9 <br>
Enter num2: 14 <br>

Output: <br>
Sum = 23 <br>
Product = 126 <br>
Average = 11.50 <br>

### Algorithm 
1. Input numbers `num1` and `num2`.
2. Calculate sum - `num1 + num2`.
3. Calculate product - `num1 * num2`.
4. Calculate average - `[num1 + num2] / 2`
5. Print the sum, product and average.
