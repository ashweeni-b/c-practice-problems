## Scanning Numbers 

### Problem Statement
Keep scanning numbers (num) from user until condition is satisfied.

---

### Input
Scan input number num from users.

### Output 
Break the scanning loop until condition is not satisfied and print the message

---

### Algorithm 
1. Initialize `num`.
2. Run infinite for loop (infinite for loop is the loop which do not have all or either of initialization, condition and updation statements)
3. Scan number `num` from user.
4. If `num` is not satisfying the condition, output that condition is not encountered.
5. End the loop by breaking it.
