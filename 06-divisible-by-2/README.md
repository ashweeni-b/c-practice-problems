## Divisible by 2

### Problem Statement
Take a number (n) from user and output whether it is divisible by 2 or not.

---

### Input
A single integer N representing the number whose divisibility by 2 needs to be checked.

### Output Format 1
Print 1 if divisible by 2 or 0 if not divisible by 2.

---

### Test Case 1
Input: 2 <br>
Output: 1 <br>

### Test Case 2
Input: 5 <br>
Output: 0 <br>

---

### Algorithm (Approach 1)
1. Input `N`.
2. Check if `N` is divisible by 2 or not - `N % 2 == 0`.
3. If `N` is divisible by 2 output `1` otherwise `0`.
